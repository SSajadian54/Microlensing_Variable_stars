# Microlensing of radial and nonradial pulsating stars 

There are 4 codes written in C++. They make single and binary microlensing events from radial and nonradial pulsating stars. The codes generate microlensing events according to the known distribution functions of the lens and source stars toward the Galactic bulge.
The codes also generate synthetic data points taken by the OGLE, and KMTNet groups and evaluate the detectability of pulsating signatures in the light curves. 
For calculating finite-source microlensing and binary ones, the codes use the VBBinaryLensing package. 

The codes use several pre-made files containing photometry information of stars in our galaxy made by the Besancon model, extinction in different lines of sight extracted from Marshall's map, and photometry errors versus magnitude for OGLE and KMTNet observations (which are uploaded).  
In case you want to use these codes, you should have these pre-made files, so in that case please contact me: sedighe.sajadian@gmail.com.  

If these codes are helpful for your research works and use their results in your own research, please cite these papers:
